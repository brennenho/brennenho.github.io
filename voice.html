            <h1>Cover Letter</h1>
            <p>Dear Editors and Mr. Kandell, <br><br>

                I would like to express my interest in a leadership position during the 2021 - 2022 school year. I feel that a leadership position will help me grow and mature as a person, while also letting me explore more aspects of journalism and journalistic writing. Although I have not been a member of the staff for very long, I am a quick learner and can think on my feet.<br><br>
                
                Specifically, I am interested in the positions of News Editor, Feature Editor, and Webmaster. I believe I’m qualified for any of these positions, due to my dedication and ability to cooperate with others. For both editing positions, I am able to provide feedback that lifts people up and helps them improve, instead of overly criticizing. While I may not be fully versed in AP style yet, I intend to invest time into learning it backward and forward. Knowing how to turn that knowledge into constructive feedback, however, is a skill much harder to learn. I have had practice with this on the Paly Robotics team, where I taught younger members how to use power tools, and provided constructive feedback when they made mistakes.<br><br>
                
                I also believe I am well suited for the position of webmaster, due to my knowledge of websites and specifically WordPress. I successfully created a WordPress website that I used as a general portfolio and blog, which I transitioned to an HTML site run through GitHub Pages. Through both processes, I paid special attention to page design, and learned how to use many different data collection tools to track user statistics, such as bounce rates, session duration, etc.<br><br>
                
                Overall, I’d say my leadership style is one of initiative and drive, and when I’m passionate about something, I can get it done with ease. I’m very observant and detail-oriented but sometimes struggle with public speaking. I believe this can be overcome with some effort and more practice, which I am willing to do.<br><br>
                
                In terms of the structure of class, it can definitely feel overwhelming at the beginning. This effect may have been compounded with the effect of distance learning, but there was definitely a lot to keep track of when starting in Voice. In addition, I feel like a lot of things were a bit unclear or not apparent to start with, which resulted in me talking with upperclassmen many times to clarify certain procedures. I think this could be easily fixed by having a more in-depth orientation in which all procedures are explained in detail, especially when it comes to editing and formatting in WordPress. I also feel that it would be beneficial to have a pacer for new staff, in order for them to understand how to meet the story credit requirement before the end of the semester.<br><br>
                
                Finally, I feel like the overall editing process could be streamlined, in order to increase efficiency and get stories out sooner rather than later. From my experience, stories are mostly written in google docs, then transferred to WordPress in order to get edits. I feel that it would be much easier to have a shared google drive in which edits can be given directly onto google docs, at least for the first 2 rounds of edits. When going through edits, using google docs definitely makes it easier to keep track of what has been dealt with and what still needs to be fixed. While this may prevent people from adding tags and formatting properly until they transfer their article into WordPress, those are pretty small aspects of the article and can likely be fixed in one round of edits, if there are issues.<br><br>
                
                In terms of adapting to the rapidly evolving media sphere, I feel that Voice needs to start with the basics. Firstly, the website could use a large update, as it is cluttered and hard to use. Being a fully online publication, our website should be the most up-to-date and easiest to use. I also feel like it could be beneficial to branch out into other types of media, such as podcasts, but might be difficult to pull off successfully.<br><br>
                
                I hope this letter has given you a look into why I am interested in a leadership position, as well as why I believe I am qualified. While my portfolio may be sparse currently, I am working hard to continue to write high-quality, impactful articles.<br><br>
                
                Sincerely,<br>
                Brennen
                </p>
